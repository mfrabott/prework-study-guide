# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description


This prework sutudy guide was built to give me a jump start on learning to code and remembering the lessons learned in prior to the start of the Bootcamp. It will allow me to take notes and refer to them so as not to forget the building blocks established throughout the Prework Modules. I was able to learn some basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
